    "# US Senate Project  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project began with a question about historical change in the United States Senate. Seeking an answer, I wondered if a database of US senators existed. One such database can be found [here](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators) on GitHub. I also found a [chronological list](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/chronlist.pdf) of all US senators posted in a PDF file by The Senate Historical Office. The chronological list caught my interest.     \n",
    "\n",
    "About 231 years ago, on March 4, 1789, the First Congress convened, and Richard Bassett of Delaware was registered as the first person to serve as a US Senator. Since then there have been 1984 US senators. The most recent addition to their ranks was Kelly Loeffler, who began her service on January 6, 2020. She joined the 116th Congress as Senator for Georgia. Each Senator has a unique historical rank between 1 and 1984. The chronological list posted by The Senate Historical Office records this history, senator by senator, grouped by congress and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a document designed for human readers, the chronological list has merit. With each congress and year highlighted in bold, amidst a design with ample white space, readers may easily scan for desired information and scroll to particular points in the chronology. One may also search the list in simple ways using a PDF reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, containing all these historical data in a PDF file greatly limits their utility. The data can't be searched in more complex ways, nor can they be easily combined with other data. Therein lies the motivation and objective of this project. I set for myself the task of extracting the data from the PDF, transforming them, and loading them into a more useful format."

Charges of ﬁfraud and corruptionﬂ in his campaign were made throughout the spring and summer of 1926, but he won election handily. When his predecessor (William B. McKinley) died in early December 1926, Smith was appointed to fill the vacancy in the term ending March 3, 1927; he presented credentials as a Senator-designate but was not permitted to qualify. He then presented credentials as a Senator-elect to the United States Senate for the term beginning March 4, 1927, but again was not permitted to qualify and subsequently tendered his resignation on February 9, 1928, after the Senate voted that Smith was not entitled to his seat. 6 Vare presented his credentials as a senator-elect at the convening on Congress on Dec. 5, 1927, but his opponents moved to block his seating, and his case was referred to the Committee on Privileges and Elections; meanwhile, Vare was not permitted to qualify. On Dec. 6, 1929, the Senate voted to deny Senator-elect Vare a seat in the Senate. Start of Initial    Senate Service Name/Party   End of Service Rank    54 December 7 Larrazolo, Octaviano A.

Charges of ﬁfraud and corruptionﬂ in his campaign were made throughout the spring and summer of 1926, but he won election handily. When his predecessor (William B. McKinley) died in early December 1926, Smith was appointed to fill the vacancy in the term ending March 3, 1927; he presented credentials as a Senator-designate but was not permitted to qualify. He then presented credentials as a Senator-elect to the United States Senate for the term beginning March 4, 1927, but again was not permitted to qualify and subsequently tendered his resignation on February 9, 1928, after the Senate voted that Smith was not entitled to his seat. 6 Vare presented his credentials as a senator-elect at the convening on Congress on Dec. 5, 1927, but his opponents moved to block his seating, and his case was referred to the Committee on Privileges and Elections; meanwhile, Vare was not permitted to qualify. On Dec. 6, 1929, the Senate voted to deny Senator-elect Vare a seat in the Senate. Start of Initial    Senate Service Name/Party   End of Service Rank    54 December 7 Larrazolo, Octaviano A.
